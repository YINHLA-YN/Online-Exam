# Online-Exam
JAVA/ JAVA SWING( This is a system that I have created that copies how an actual exam is structured and a user can sign up and login in into the system in order to write the exam while the admin can be able to manage what the clients are doing and can also add or remove questions etc) )
in order to run this project make sure that you use netbeans and just open the folder via netbeans then click run the file "Student_Login"
